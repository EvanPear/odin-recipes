        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅔ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, or as needed</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced shallots</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather Ingredients</li>
            <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.</li>
            <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
